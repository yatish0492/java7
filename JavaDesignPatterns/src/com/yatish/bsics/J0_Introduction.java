    Why do we need design patterns?
        These are standard patterns we can use in out product development. Consider i needed singleton pattern in my
        code and I develop my own. Chances are high that I might miss something and it can be broken, so if we use
        already existing pattern, then they are already accepted by wider community and tested for non breakage of
        singleton so we can be assure of it instead of we spending extra effort to come up with the design by our own.


    There are 3 types of Design patters
        1) Creational Patterns
        2) Structural Patterns
        3) Behavioral Patterns
