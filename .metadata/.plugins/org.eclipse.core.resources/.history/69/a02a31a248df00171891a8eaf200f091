		 * How is string stored internally?
		 * It is stored as charecter array 'char[]'
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * I have heard string is immutable and final, can you please explain?
		 * one we create a string we cannot change it. even if we do some modification to the string, there will be a new string created, the existing string will not be changed.
		 * eg: s = "yatish";
		 * 	   s = "Gagan";		--> In this case, "yatish" will not be changed to "Gagan" in memeory. a new string "Gagan" will be created and that reference will be assigned to 's'. "yatish" will be
		 * 							cleaned up by garbage collector if there are no other reference.
		 * similarly, s.toUpperCase()/s.toLowerCase()/s.substr() etc won't change the 's' variable. It will create new result string and return it.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * What is String pool?
		 * The strings are stored in a pool called 'string pool'. It will be present in the heap memory.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * What is string literal vs string object?
		 * String literal --> String s = "abc";
		 * String object  --> String s = new String("abc");
		 * 
		 * String literal --> String s = "abc";
		 * 					  String m = "abc";	--> In this case, java will not create new string "abc" in string pool. First java will check whether if "abc" is already present in the string pool 
		 * 											or not. if it is present then it will point to the existing string instead of creating new one. In this case, it will reference to the existing 
		 * 											"abc" string in the string pool.
		 * String object  --> String s = new String("abc");  --> This will create a new string "abc" in string pool, irrespective of whether already "abc"  is present in the string pool or not.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * How does spring check whether if the string is already present in the string pool or not?
		 *
