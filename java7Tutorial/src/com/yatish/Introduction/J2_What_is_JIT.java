	 * What is JIT compiler?
	 * JIT stands for 'Just In Time' compiler.
	 * 
	 * Is JIT compiler a different compiler for java?
	 * No!!! 'JIT' is a concept, if a compiler works as per that concept then we call that compiler as 'JIT compiler'.
	 * 
	 * What does JIT compiler do?
	 * Consider there is code which is executed more number of times like say we are executing a function 1000 times, then each and every time we call the function, JVM will convert the byte code of
	 * that function into binary code 1000 times before executing. So 'JIT' will concept says, to cache the binary code of repeatedly executed piece of code in memory. so then next time it is
	 * executed, the byte code of that piece of code is not converted into binary code, instead the binary code is fetched from cache and executed hence performance optimization.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * What are you saying, there are lot of JVM available?
	 * Yes!!!
	 * JVM by Oracle,openjdk,ibm etc. The JVM provided by Oracle is have 'JIT' compiler.
