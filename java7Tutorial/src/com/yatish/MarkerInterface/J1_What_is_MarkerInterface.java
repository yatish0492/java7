	/*
	 * What is Marker Interface?
	 * Marker Interface is nothing but an interface without any fields or methods in it. It is basically a empty interface.
	 * 
	 * What all Marker Interface do we use in java?
	 * Serializable, Cloneable etc.
	 * 
	 * So if marker interface doesn't have any fields or methods, then why the hell do we use them?
