	 * What is Callable?
	 * Callable is same like 'Runnable'
	 * 
	 * If both 'Callable' and 'Runnable' are same then, we have 'Runnable', why the hell was 'Callable' invented?
	 * you cannot return a value from the thread using 'Runnable', we write 'run()' method with return type as 'void'. Where as in 'Callable' we write the 'call()' method instead of 'run()' and the 
	 * return type of 'call()' method is 'Object'.
