	/*
	 * What is Polymorphism?
	 * There are 2 types of polymorphism in java as follows,
	 * 1) Compile time polymorphism.
	 * 2) Run time polymorphism.
	 * 
	 * What is compile time polymorphism?
	 * 'OverLoading' is compile time polymorphism. because, the compiler will know while compiling itself about which method will be invoked.
	 * 
	 * What is run time polymorphism?
	 * 'Overriding' is run time polymorphism. because, the compiler will not know which class overriden method in hierarchy will be invoked, It will be decided at run time.
