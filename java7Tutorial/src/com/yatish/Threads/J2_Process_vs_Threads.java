/*
 * What is the difference between Process and Threads?

	Process
	-------
	1) Each process have its own address in memory i.e. each process allocates separate memory area.
		Process is heavy weight.
	2) Cost of communication between the process is high.
	3) Switching from one process to another require some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists etc.
	
	Threads
	-------
	1) Threads share the same address space.
	2) Thread is lightweight.
	3) Cost of communication between the thread is low.
